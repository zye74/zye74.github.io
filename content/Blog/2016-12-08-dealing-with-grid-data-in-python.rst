:summary: In my PhD research, I do a lot of analysis of 2D and 3D grid data output by simulations I run. In my analyses, it's very helpful to restructure these data into a more useable format. A few key lines of python code do the trick.

.. role:: python(code)
    :language: python

.. default-role:: python

In my PhD research, I do a lot of analysis of 2D and 3D grid data output by simulations I run. If, for example, I had a toy system that was 3x2x2 grid points, the raw data would be structured sort of like this:

.. code-block:: none

    x   y   z   value
    0   0   0   0.9
    1   0   0   1.1
    2   0   0   0.8
    0   1   0   1.1
    1   1   0   1.0
    2   1   0   0.9
    0   0   1   0.6
    1   0   1   1.2
    2   0   1   0.8
    0   1   1   0.9
    1   1   1   1.2
    2   1   1   1.3

In my analyses, it's very helpful to restructure these data into a format where, in this case, `x = [0, 1, 2]`, `y = [0, 1]`, `z = [0, 1]`, and `value` is a 3D array such that `value[i, j, k]` returns the value corresponding to position `(x[i], y[j], z[k])`.

It's easy to do that in just a few lines. Say the above raw data is stored in `data.dat`.

.. code:: python

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x, y, z, value = np.loadtxt('data.dat', skiprows=1).T
    >>> x, y, z = np.unique(x), np.unique(y), np.unique(z)
    >>> nx, ny, nz = len(x), len(y), len(z)
    >>> value = value.reshape((nz, ny, nx)).T

Note that if the raw data had `x` varying the slowest and `z` varying the fastest, the final line would look like `value = value.reshape((nx, ny, nz))`.

Finally, if you want to go the other way, where you have your `x`, `y`, and `z` arrays and 3D `values` array, you can make use of the `sklearn.utils.extmath.cartesian` function (first introduced on this `StackOverflow post`_. If you want `z` to be the fastest changing variable, it would look something like this:

.. _`StackOverflow post`: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1235363/2680824

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from sklearn.utils.extmath import cartesian
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x, y, z = [0, 1, 2], [0, 1], [0, 1]
    >>> nx, ny, nz = len(x), len(y), len(z)
    >>> value = np.arange(nx*ny*nz).reshape((nx,ny,nz)) # define 3D value array
    >>> xyz = cartesian((z, y, x))
    >>> value = value.flatten()
    >>> np.hstack((xyz, value[:,None]))
    array([[ 0,  0,  0,  0],
           [ 0,  0,  1,  1],
           [ 0,  1,  0,  2],
           [ 0,  1,  1,  3],
           [ 1,  0,  0,  4],
           [ 1,  0,  1,  5],
           [ 1,  1,  0,  6],
           [ 1,  1,  1,  7],
           [ 2,  0,  0,  8],
           [ 2,  0,  1,  9],
           [ 2,  1,  0, 10],
           [ 2,  1,  1, 11]])

The `value[:,None]` thing on the last line adds an extra dimension to the 1D value array so the elements of the tuple passed to `np.hstack` are both 2D numpy arrays.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> value.shape
    (12,)
    >>> value[:,None].shape
    (12, 1)
    >>> value[None,:].shape
    (1, 12)
